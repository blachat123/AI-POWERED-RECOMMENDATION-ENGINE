Description
------------

This project is a Python-based movie recommendation engine with a RESTful API backend. It uses the Surprise library's SVD algorithm for collaborative filtering to generate personalized movie recommendations. Built with Flask, it provides three main endpoints: a health check, a recommendation fetcher for specific users, and a rating submission endpoint. The system leverages the MovieLens dataset for demonstration, predicting user preferences based on historical ratings and returning movie titles, genres, and predicted ratings. It's designed to be extensible for production use with additional features like database integration and authentication.
